AI Classification Project: KNN, Random Forest, SVM
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)—for classification tasks. The focus is on comparing the performance of these algorithms on a dataset, optimizing their parameters, and analyzing the accuracy of the models.

Objectives
Develop and train models using KNN, Random Forest, and SVM.
Evaluate and compare model accuracy.
Explore hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
Visualize the results for clear model comparison.
Algorithms Used
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, instance-based learning algorithm.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method based on decision trees.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classifier for high-dimensional data.
Dataset
This project uses [your chosen dataset's name] for the classification task. The dataset contains [brief description of the data, like features and target variable]. Data preprocessing steps include feature scaling, normalization, and handling missing data.

Results
Algorithm	Accuracy	Precision	Recall
