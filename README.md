# AI Classification Project: KNN, Random Forest, SVM

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms—**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**—for classification tasks. The focus is on comparing the performance of these algorithms on a dataset, optimizing their parameters, and analyzing the accuracy of the models.

## Objectives
- Develop and train models using **KNN**, **Random Forest**, and **SVM**.
- Evaluate and compare model accuracy.
- Explore hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
- Visualize the results for clear model comparison.

## Algorithms Used
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method based on decision trees.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classifier for high-dimensional data.

## Dataset
This project uses [your chosen dataset's name] for the classification task. The dataset contains [brief description of the data, like features and target variable]. Data preprocessing steps include feature scaling, normalization, and handling missing data.

## Results
| Algorithm        | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|------------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| KNN              | 80%      | XX%       | XX%    |
| Random Forest    | 95%      | XX%       | XX%    |
| SVM              | 85%      | XX%       | XX%    |

- The **Random Forest** algorithm showed the highest accuracy, followed by **SVM** and **KNN**.
- Hyperparameter tuning improved model performance, especially for **SVM**.
